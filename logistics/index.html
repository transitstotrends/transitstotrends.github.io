            Make sure to have POP in the filename to distinguish it from your actual poster.

    IMPORTANT: there will only be one round of shuttles, so if you miss it, there are a few bus options (free), or you can walk, or Uber, depending on your comfort level.

<p><strong>PARKING:</strong>
    If you wish to drive and park on campus, you may park in the Cornell structure (red pin in the attached map below). The rates are a ridiculous $1.75 per half hour, with a maximum of $28 for 8 hours, but it is very close to the PAIS building.

<h3>Wifi connectivity</h3>

    </p>
<h3>General Health Advice</h3>
    <p>
        Albuquerque is a desert climate and is at high altitude. During the summer and in the daylight hours, it can get quite hot and the sun can be quite strong. You should take steps to protect yourself (e.g. bring/purchase sunscreen and a hat), drink lots of water (more than you might otherwise think!), and take it easy with exercise (especially if you're not adjusted to high altitude).
