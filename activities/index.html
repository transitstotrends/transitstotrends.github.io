<h2>Food</h2>
    <p>
        Albuquerque's culinary scene is a reflection of its cultural heritage, primarily influenced by Native American and Spanish traditions, resulting in the distinctive New Mexican cuisine. 
        The star of the show is undoubtedly the chile, available in both green (younger, with a zesty flavor) and red (ripened, with an earthier, smoky taste). 
        A common question you'll hear is "Red or Green?", or you can answer "Christmas" to get both on your dish!

    </p>
    
    <p>
        For a truly authentic experience, try carne adovada, pork marinated and slow-cooked in red chile sauce. 
        You can find excellent versions at Mary & Tito's Cafe, a James Beard Award winner known for its classic New Mexican dishes, or The Original Cocina Azul, a family-owned spot with flavorful homemade enchiladas and carne adovada. 
        Green chile stew, a hearty and often spicy soup with green chile, pork, and potatoes, is another must-try; 
        Frontier Restaurant, a local institution near UNM, is famous for its generous portions and green chile stew. 
        And of course, you can't leave without trying a green chile cheeseburger, a New Mexico staple, with many local diners offering their own delicious take. 
        For a taste of tradition within a cultural landmark, Indian Pueblo Kitchen at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center offers dishes prepared with ancient techniques and local ingredients. 
        If you're looking for a lively atmosphere and strong community ties, Sadie's of New Mexico is a popular choice, known for its heaping plates and flavorful chile.
